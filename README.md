Some modificated files for the simulator Pokémon Online (PO). Our main goal is to add USUM and SwSh movepools to PO. So far, we have:
- USUM changes in movepools (tutors and some learnsets by level up)
- LGPE movepools (however, LGPE is not available as a "subgeneration". We had compatibility problems with USUM). The legacy in those movepools (such as Clefable + Teleport) appears in 8th gen.
- SwSh movepools (original SwSh + Isle of Armor + Crown Tundra additions)

To do:
- Add released Pokémon from DLCs (it is not difficult, I just need to update 8G/releases.txt using a script).
- Remove unnecessary files in 7G/sprites.zip and 8G/sprites.zip.
- Program SwSh abilities and items (to do this, we have to modify PO internal files, and we will need A LOT of help).



If you want to add this files for your PO client, go to PO folder/db and paste the files of this db folder.

Or, you can install it as a Database Mod by downloading as a .zip file and charge it in the option "Mods" of your Team Builder.
