# pokemon-online
Some modificated files for the simulator Pokémon Online (PO). Our main goal is to add USUM and SwSh movepools to PO. So far, we have:
- USUM improvements (tutors, changes in learnsets by leveling up, Necrozma formes, Lycanroc-Dusk, new Ultra Beasts and Zeraora)
- LGPE movepools (however, LGPE is not available as a "subgeneration". We had compatibility problems with USUM). The legacy of those movepools (such as Clefable + Teleport) appears in 8th gen.
- SwSh movepools (original SwSh + Isle of Armor + Crown Tundra additions)

To do:
- Add released Pokémon from DLCs (it is not difficult, I just need to update 8G/releases.txt using a script).
- Make stale attacks (like Hidden Power) unusable in SwSh.
- Remove unnecessary files in 7G/sprites.zip and 8G/sprites.zip.
- National Dex as a subgen of SwSh.
- Program SwSh abilities and items (to do this, we have to modify PO internal files, and we will need A LOT of help).

# About sprites

Note: I always used BW-style sprites for 6th and 7th gen -- personally, I am more comfortable using those images than the ones the program brings by default. That's the reason why I used fan-made sprites for SwSh, too. They were extracted from Smogon's X/Y Sprite Project, Sun/Moon Sprite Project and Sword/Shield Sprite Project, respectively. If you think we should use modern-style sprites, feel free to build your own 8G/sprites.zip file and share it with us. All contributions are welcome!

# How do I use this files

If you want to add this files for your PO client, go to PO folder/db and paste the files of this db folder.

Or, you can install it as a Database Mod by downloading as a .zip file and charge it in the option "Mods" of your Team Builder.

# Where can I battle in USUM/SwSh?

You can only use these files on servers that have already installed them. Unafortunately, Pokémon Online's Main Server is not one of those servers.

Supremacy RPG server is always up-to-date with the changes of this repository, so (at least) you can play USUM/SwSh there.
